# PExplorer
PExplorer is a linux terminal tool written in C which handles parsing of PE files. <br>
PE (Portable Executable) is the format used by Win32 systems for executable (image) and object files, analogous <br>
to ELF in linux based systems.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format) regarding the PE Format.
